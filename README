Small POS

Author: Michael N. Bilgore

Description:
	Small POS is a small open source project to keep track of sales
for a small portable sales environment (fairs, craft shows, conventions
, etc.).  It aims to provide a fairly simple and reliable enviroment to
record sales for future review.  It must be very efficient so that it 
can run on cheap portable hardware such as a raspberry pi.

Work so far:
As of now all the program does is allow you to quit or sell an item
and it provides you with change owed.
