Small POS

Author: Michael N. Bilgore

Description:
	Small POS is a small open source project to keep track of sales
for a small portable sales environment (fairs, craft shows, conventions
, etc.).  It aims to provide a fairly simple and reliable enviroment to
record sales for future review.  It must be very efficient so that it 
can run on cheap portable hardware such as a raspberry pi.

Work so far:
As of now all the program does is allow you to quit or sell an item
and it provides you with change owed.

Windows testing instructions:
included is a script to test out the program on windows.  to use
open up git bash in the repo directory (gcc.exe must be in the
windows path) run: "chmod +x wintest.sh" (no quotes) this only
must be done one time you can then run the script with the following
command:
./wintest.sh
This will compile the program into a file pos.exe run the file then
remove the file.
