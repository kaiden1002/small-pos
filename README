Small POS

Author: Michael N Bilgore

Description:
	Small POS is a small open source project to keep track of sales
for a small portable sales environment (fairs, craft shows, conventions
, etc.).  It aims to provide a fairly simple and reliable enviroment to
record sales for future review.  It must be very efficient so that it 
can run on cheap portable hardware such as a raspberry pi.
